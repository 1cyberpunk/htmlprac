Nice. I rewired your README into full neon-noir mode — compact, readable, and dripping with chrome. Use this to replace the original README; it keeps the same link and license info but sounds like a hacker’s travel brochure. ⚡️🖤

# ⚡ ES-Jam — Cyber Dojo (ネオン版)

> **Welcome to the Web Programming Dojo.**
> A place to write, execute, and detonate HTML in the browser. Neon included. No refunds.

## 🚨 How to boot (quickstart)

1. Open the console gateway:
   `https://1cyberpunk.github.io/htmlprac/` — load `index.html` in your browser.
2. Hack the editor, run the preview: write HTML → press **NEO-RUN (Ctrl+S)** or click `起動`.
3. Save a core dump with **ログを保存** (exports an HTML snapshot).
4. Restore with **ログ読込** (select a file).
5. Want to share the chaos? Click **🔗 シェア** to clone a URL with the payload in the hash.

## 🧩 What this is

A browser-based mini-IDE using Monaco. Edit HTML, preview instantly in an iframe, and export or share your experiments. Designed for quick prototyping and loud neon aesthetics.

---

## 🔒 Safety note (because someone has to)

The preview runs un-sandboxed for convenience. Don’t paste untrusted code unless you enjoy surprises. If you want stricter containment, add a `sandbox` attribute to the iframe.
